# TODOS:


#### Bugs
- [ ] Animation when scaled (the animation isn't smooth)
- [ ] Invalid labelPosition doesn't set 'bottom' as default (need to change it in the markup?!)

#### Code
- [ ] Check if css custom properties are valid (revert to default?)
- [ ] Rewrite styles in CSS and import them in element
- [ ] Find way to load only the necessary css file (according to button type)
- [ ] Add custom-components.json file (https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-json)
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Improve A11y
- [ ] Test if `targetSelectors` and `targetClasses` order throws an error
- [ ] Remove outline when button is clicked
